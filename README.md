This repo contains code to convince me of the Monty Hall Problem.

Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance."

This was a difficult concept for me to wrap my head around.  To convince myself that the math works out, I've created this repo to perform many simulations of minigames.  Spoiler alert - the math checks out!  The simulations can be run in commandline or in the jupyter notebook.
